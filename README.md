# Duplicate bib exorciser
This is a dumb-ish script in python to generate a new bib.bib file for LaTeX without duplicate entries. It is sensitive to formatting and should be fixed soon to be more rounded.

### Input
File named 'bib.bib'.

### Output
File named 'newbib.bib' without repeated entries.
